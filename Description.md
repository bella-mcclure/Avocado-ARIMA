What is green, desirable, and fluctuating in value? Though the dollar bill may come to mind, the small but mighty avocado is also a valid answer. As of recent years, the fruit has grown immensely in popularity, specifically in the United States. The avocado consumption surge is due to various factors, including increased awareness of their health benefits and versatility in culinary applications; however, as economics has taught us, an increase in demand with the same supply will increase the price and that is precisely what has occurred. This paper will delve into the dynamic landscape of avocado pricing, employing advanced forecasting techniques to decipher the intricate interplay of factors influencing the market. Focusing on the unique characteristics of avocado price fluctuations, our study employs time series analysis to unravel seasonal patterns that have previously eluded traditional forecasting models. Through a meticulous examination of historical data provided by Hass Avocado Board, the author will uncover the nuances helpful to distributors and consumers alike.
